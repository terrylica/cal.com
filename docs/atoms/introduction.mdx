## What are atoms?

Atoms are React components from the `@calcom/atoms` package that handle everything from UI rendering to API calls. Simply import an atom and drop it into your code - it handles the rest.

```jsx
import { Booker } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function BookingPage() {
  return (
    <Booker
      eventSlug="30min"
      username="john"
      onCreateBookingSuccess={(data) => {
        console.log("Booking created:", data);
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

## Key features

- **Ready-to-use UI** - Pre-built components for booking, availability, calendars, and more
- **Full customization** - Style with custom classNames and Tailwind CSS
- **Event callbacks** - React to user actions with callback props
- **Managed users** - Handle scheduling for your users without them needing Cal.com accounts

## Requirements
